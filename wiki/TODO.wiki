= Details =

  * Fix resizing
  * Fix (or remove, or move functionality to ‘browse’) the ‘Manage’ tab
  * Correct ‘new folder’ function allowing spaces in folder name
  * Maybe combine this into it’s own TinyMCE plugin rather than expanding advimage, so we can incorporate movies/flash and allow document uploads
  * refactor PHP code inside the CI application
  * Apply prettier skin to TinyMCE and the modal pop-up ( http://thebigreason.com/blog/2008/09/29/thebigreason-tinymce-skin )
  * Model/s: use the db class methods ([http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/database/active_record.html Active Record]) instead of raw queries. 
  * use model objects instead of arrays. this means a lot of template changes
  * create and use CI config files
  * Drink a beer and become CI celebs

Other notes:
After resizing, image doesn't appear as resized until you refresh the dialogue?
Always overwrites original after saving (after resizing)
‘Manage’ tab doesn't seem to do much yet (necessary?)
Validation on adding new folder (removing spaces for dashes - )

I notice the file upload types are limited to images, however I think the aim should be to use this uploader/browser for uploading videos/flash files. Currently TinyMCE can generate code for flash/quicktime/wmv types. Also, allowing types such as .doc, .pdf would be ideal. Not sure how the front end is built but I guess this would maybe mean replacing the ‘add image’ ‘add movie’ buttons in Tiny MCE with a general ‘Add Media’ button. Makes sense to me?
