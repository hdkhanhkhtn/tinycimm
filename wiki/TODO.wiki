= Details =

  * Fix resizing
  * Fix (or remove, or move functionality to ‘browse’) the ‘Manage’ tab
  * Correct ‘new folder’ function allowing spaces in folder name
  * Maybe combine this into it’s own TinyMCE plugin rather than expanding advimage, so we can incorporate movies/flash and allow document uploads
  * refactor PHP code inside the CI application
  * Apply prettier skin to TinyMCE and the modal pop-up ( http://thebigreason.com/blog/2008/09/29/thebigreason-tinymce-skin )
  * Model/s: use the db class methods ([http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/database/active_record.html Active Record]) instead of raw queries. 
  * Drink a beer and become CI celebs
