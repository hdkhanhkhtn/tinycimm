= Introduction =

TinyCIMM isn't much at this stage, but has a lot of potential.
It would be good to define what we want to achieve, in what approach and direction.

*Phase 1:*

I think it's best we start small and simple.
The most useful part of the plugin is the image manager, I suggest we focus on getting the image manager working, _as is_ and bug-free, before moving onto additional functionality.

What does this involve:

  * Cleanup! Lots of re-factoring, simplifying the code, and sticking it in the right places. 
  * Bug fixing! Fixing the bugs that we are aware of.
  * Testing! Finding those sneaky bugs

I think piggy-backing off of the advance image plugin is OK for now, I like the simplicity of not opening up another modal, but it is definitely worth revisiting, perhaps once Phase 1 is complete? We want to offer a package that is easyily integrated, expecting users to hack changes into an existing plugin is just not on, we do need to think an elegant of doing this.
Please have a look at [http://code.google.com/p/tinycimm/wiki/ImageManagerFeatures this wiki page] that I wrote over a year ago for more info.
